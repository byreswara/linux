emulation of a shell
--------------------------------
nested shell (means inside shell)

" screen and bg " commands are used for emulation.

these are almost equal. but most bg are not used in environment

these are used when we are not present.

screen
-----------
screen is not inbuilt command. if not installed...

>> yum install screen  (to insatall screen command)

if we run a program in screen, it will run even logout.

>> screen -S  <socket name>   (to enter nested shell)

>> ctrl a+d    (to quit or detached nested shell)

>> screen -ls   (to listout sockets which are running in nested shell)

>>screen -r <PID.socketname>  to resume the socket
  ex: screen -r 2715.name

>> screen -X -S <PID.socketname> quit  (to delete the screen seccion) 
      we can use " kill " also instead of   " quit " to kill the process.
 
 note: after complete the job we should delete it.

jobs     (this is mostly not used)
-------
command  &   (this command run in background)

jobs  (it will shows list of jobs run in background)

fg <job number>  (it resume that job)

ctrl + z  (back to foreground)

bg <job number>  (it shows which job is running)  

kill -9 %<job no.>   (it kill that process) 

uname 
-----------
>> uname -a (details of os and more)

>> uname -r  (kernal version)

>> uname -s  (os name)

>> uname -m (platform)

>> uname -p (platform)

>> uname -n (node name)

df and du
---------------
df (disk file system)

df command not work in solaries

>>df -h  (how many mounted file systems are there)

>>df -k  (it displys in kilobytes)

>>df -i  (it displys inode filesystem)    its importent 

>>df -Ph (file system entry per line)

>>df -PhT  (it shows file system)

du (disk usage)
-----------------------
du -sh <directory name>   (it shows directory usage size)
note: ls -ld  <directory name> (it shows only directory default size)
          ls -l  <directory name>    (it shows the files in the directory)

compress the data using ( tar,gzip,zip )
---------------------------------------------------------
compress the data means, it reduce network bandwidth.

it compress the data by   65% average

bundle the data by using tar
 
zip
-----
it compress the data and bundel the files
>> zip  <targetname.zip>  <source file>  (to zip or compress the file)

>> zip -r  <targetname.zip>  <source directory>  (to zip the directory including files)

>>unzip -l <targetname.zip>  (list the ziped files)

>>unzip  <targetname.zip>     (to unzip or uncompress the file or  directory)

tar
-----
tar  -cvf  <targetname.tar>  <source name>  (to bundle the files)

tar -tvf  <targetname.tar>  (to view the tarred files)

tar -xvf  <targetname.tar>  (to untar)

tar -xvf  <targetname.tar> -C  <path>   (to untar in specific path)

gzip
-------
gzip  <source file>  (to compress the file)

gzip -r  <source directory>  (to compress the files in the directory)

gunzip -c <targetname.gz>  (listout  the compressed files)

zcat  <targetname.gz>  (listout  the compressed files)

gunzip  <targetname.gz>     (to unzip or uncompress the file or  directory)

NOTE: in this source file is replaced by new compressed file
              best way is first tar the files then do gzip

 NOTE: dont modified any application configirations or process in environment
